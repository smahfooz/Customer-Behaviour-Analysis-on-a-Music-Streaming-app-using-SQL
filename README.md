<h2><b>Executive Summary</b></h2>
<p>
  This project showcases a series of SQL queries designed to analyze streaming data. The queries address various business questions related to artist rankings, user behaviors, and streaming patterns. This case study demonstrates the application of SQL to derive valuable insights from a streaming service's dataset.
</p>
<h2>SQL Concepts Demonstrated</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Window Functions:</b> Utilized <b>RANK()</b> and <b>LAG()</b> functions to rank artists and compute session durations.</li>
    <li><b>Common Table Expressions (CTEs):</b> Employed CTEs for organizing intermediate steps in complex queries.</li>
    <li><b>Aggregations and Group By:</b> Applied aggregation functions such as COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() to summarize data.</li>
    <li><b>Joins:</b> Executed multiple join operations to combine data from different tables.</li>
    <li><b>Conditional Logic:</b> Used CASE statements to create age brackets and other conditional calculations.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3><b>Key Findings</b></h3>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Top 10 Artists per Country:</b> Identified the top 10 artists in each country based on stream count and total listening time.</li>
    <li><b>Average Streams per User and Offer Type:</b>Calculated the average number of streams per user segmented by offer type.</li>
    <li><b>Artists Representing 80% of Streams for Users Aged 18-24: </b>Determined the number of artists accounting for 80% of streams by users aged 18-24.</li>
    <li><b>Percentage of Fans:</b>Defined fans based on specific streaming criteria and calculated the percentage of users qualifying as fans.</li>
    <li><b>Average Duration of Listening Sessions by Age Bracket:</b>Computed the average duration of listening sessions for different age brackets, using two different methodologies.</li>
  </ol>
